defmodule Astarte.FlowWeb do
  @moduledoc """
  The entrypoint for defining your web interface, such
  as controllers, components, channels, and so on.

  This can be used in your application as:

      use Astarte.FlowWeb, :controller
      use Astarte.FlowWeb, :html

  The definitions below will be executed for every controller,
  component, etc, so keep them short and clean, focused
  on imports, uses and aliases.

  Do NOT define functions inside the quoted expressions
  below. Instead, define additional modules and import
  those modules here.
